## Weta GBS README

Created by Nat Forsdick, 2021, based on previous work by Victoria Twort.

This repo contains scripts used to analyse single- and paired-end GBS data from weta species, including _Deinacrida heteracantha_, _D. fallai_, and _D. mahoenui_.

The workflow moves through demultiplexing, quality control, and mapping, before processing through Stacks _ref_map_ and _populations_ pipelines. Data are output in formats for analysis with Adegenet and STRUCTURE.
